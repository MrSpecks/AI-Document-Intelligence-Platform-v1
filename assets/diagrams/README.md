# Diagrams

**Status:** Diagram assets are in development.

## Planned Diagrams

The following diagrams are planned for the [Architecture Guide](../../docs/architecture.md):

- **system-architecture.png** – Complete system overview diagram (in development)
- **data-flow.png** – Document processing data flow (in development)
- **rag-pipeline.png** – RAG analysis pipeline (in development)
- **security-architecture.png** – Multi-layer security architecture (in development)

## Current Status

ASCII diagrams in the documentation files provide conceptual overview. High-resolution visual diagrams will be added as the platform documentation matures.

**Interim Solution:** Refer to ASCII diagrams in [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md) for system visualization.
