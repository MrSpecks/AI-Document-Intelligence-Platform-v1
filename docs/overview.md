# Platform Overview

> **Note:** This document describes the platform vision and target capabilities. For current implementation status, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## The Problem

Modern enterprises struggle with document-driven workflows:

- **Manual Processing** – Legal teams spend 40+ hours/week reviewing documents
- **Error-Prone** – Manual data entry introduces 5-15% error rates
- **Slow Insights** – Days to weeks to extract actionable intelligence from documents
- **Scalability Issues** – Cannot handle document volume without hiring additional staff
- **Compliance Risk** – Missed regulatory details lead to costly violations

Documents contain critical business intelligence, but extracting and acting on it remains labor-intensive and error-prone.

## The Solution

**AI Document Intelligence Platform** automates document analysis using advanced AI:

### Core Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Document Processing**
   - Automatically extracts text, tables, and structure
   - Handles multiple document types and formats
   - Supports semi-structured and unstructured documents

2. **Semantic Understanding**
   - Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accuracy
   - Understands domain-specific context (legal, financial, HR)
   - Learns from your document patterns

3. **Structured Extraction**
   - Parties, amounts, dates, terms
   - Risk factors and compliance issues
   - Key findings and recommendations

4. **Enterprise Integration**
   - RESTful APIs for seamless workflows
   - Multi-tenant architecture
   - Real-time processing and reporting
