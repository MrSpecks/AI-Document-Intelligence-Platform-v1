# Platform Overview

## The Problem

Modern enterprises struggle with document-driven workflows:

- **Manual Processing** – Legal teams spend 40+ hours/week reviewing documents
- **Error-Prone** – Manual data entry introduces 5-15% error rates
- **Slow Insights** – Days to weeks to extract actionable intelligence from documents
- **Scalability Issues** – Cannot handle document volume without hiring additional staff
- **Compliance Risk** – Missed regulatory details lead to costly violations

Documents contain critical business intelligence, but extracting and acting on it remains labor-intensive and error-prone.
